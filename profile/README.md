## Yeah, so Discord just released [Student Hubs](https://discord.com/student-hubs) which is exactly what zcamp was supposed to be. So I don't know if its worth it to continue, but whenever I see a problem that zcamp can solve, we'll return. Feel free to read our crappy code(esp FE), reach out in case you wanna contribute and [view the demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iQ9Wb5UmXk)
